> My Course notes for [D003x.1 Applications of Linear Algebra (Part 1)](https://courses.edx.org/courses/DavidsonX/D003x.1/1T2015/courseware/863d7f9887b7473ca182829a4db2d984/e9f508e76e2b4c0dbe285b32fc3a20f4/). 


## Unit 1 Overview

* Gain an overview perspective of applications of linear algebra
* Be able to distinguish between linear and nonlinear equations
* Learn terminology of related to matrices
* Learn an algorithm that uses a matrix to visually approximate an image using ASCII characters.


### 1. When Life is Linear

There is a wonderful website [sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com), which provides many 3D models. Looking into wireframe of certain models, it's suprised to find that they are all composed of many small polygons.


### 2. Being 1 Dimensional

A **linear equation** looks like any other equation. It is made up of two expressions set equal to each other. A linear equation is special because: 

* It has one or more variables.
* No variable in a linear equation is raised to a power greater than 1 or used as the denominator of a fraction.
* When you find pairs of values that make the linear equation true and plot those pairs on a coordinate grid, all of the points for any one equation lie on the same line. Linear equations graph as straight lines.


### 3. Matrix Magic


create your own [ASCII Art](http://math365.org/lifeislinear/ASCIIart/ASCIIart.html) 


$$
\forall x \in X, \quad \exists y \leq \epsilon
$$
