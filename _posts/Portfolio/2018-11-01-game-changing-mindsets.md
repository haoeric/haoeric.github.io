### 1. Cheat it till you make it

A lot of things will be learnt on the job. This is nothing about cheating others, it's about confidence in yourself and always saying YES to your potential.

### 2. Always work with people better than you


### 3. Be adaptive to interruptions

And while working on one project, your subconscious mind is actually mulling over and working out the problems of your other projects. Often, **stepping away and taking a break from one thing is the most productive thing you can do**. When you interrupt what youâ€™re doing and work on something else, your brain becomes more adaptive and flexible. When you come back to a project after an interruption, your brain is forced to go deeper into the memory well to retrieve what you were doing. This intensified memory retrieval actually deepens the memory, making it deeper learned and ingrained.
