### 1. Matched data

#### R Code

{% highlight r linenos %}

diff <- test2 - test1
n <- sum(!is.na(diff)) #49
mean(diff) #2.88
sd(diff) #7.61
testStat <- sqrt(n) * mean(diff) / sd(diff) #2.65
# below works out to be 0.01
2 * pt(abs(testStat), n -1, lower.tail = FALSE)
##uses the R function
t.test(diff)

{% endhighlight %}

 * 1 note this is not obtained by averaging the two standard deviations, itâ€™s obtained by averaging the variances then square rooting
