### 1. why a R package and what?


### 2. Requirements!
To be cool, the most important requirement for building a R package is a [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/).
If you are not or not willing to use **Rstudio**, then you can skip this blog and you must prefer reading the "corny" [Writing R extensions](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html) (well I don't mean that!). Anyway, it's not cool to build a package without Rstudio, and I promise you will love it.

Open the Rstudio link above and download the suitable version for your computer and install. On Windows, you will get the interface as below when you launch Rstudio:

![Rstudio GUI screenshot](pictures/Rstudio_screenshot.png)
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::embed_png("pictures/Rstudio_screenshot.png", dpi = 220)
```

Several imported places on this interface is labbled, take a look, and you will need them later.

### 3. Let's get started:
On the left panel of the Rstudio interface is your R console, where executes your R commands. One thing you may concern if where the working directory is. Using the commnad below to check your working directory and change to where you want to build you package.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd()
setwd("xxx/yyy/yourWorkingDirectory")
```

Well, we are ready to build our package, have you got the name for your package, how about **coolRer**. Let's start, type the commands below in your console following an Enter.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::creat("coolRer")
```

Check the **Files** button on the Rstudio and see **what happened**? Actually the skeleton for your package is created, cool or not? You can also locate to your selected working directory to check the files created for your R package:

*  An RStudio project file, **pkgname.Rproj**.
*  An **R/** directory.
*  A basic **DESCRIPTION** file.
*  A basic **NAMESPACE** file.

#### 3.1 R pakcage structure introduction

OK, seriously, we need a [tomato timer](http://tomato-timer.com/) now, there is something we need well understanding, then to be cool. For a simple package, the components listed above is enough for building a package, while, it's necessary for us to take a glance of the big structure of a poweful R package.

```{r, eval=FALSE,highlight=FALSE}
pkgName (the name of your package)
 | 
 |----DESCRIPTION 
 |---- NAMESPACE
 |---- R (R source codes)
         |---- function1.R 
         |---- function2.R 
         |---- ... 
 |---- man (help documentss)
         |---- function1.Rd 
         |---- function2.Rd 
         |---- ... 
|---- vignettes (vignette source files)
|---- data (rda data)
|---- demo (demo R codes)
|---- src (code of other language)
|---- inst (will remain in the root dir of the pkg)
         |---- doc (vignettes result files)
```

Let's take a look at what each part of the package does...
