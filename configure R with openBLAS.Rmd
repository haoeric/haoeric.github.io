Install openBLAS
=========================

In order to build OpenBLAS on Windows you will need:

* MSYS (a collection of Unix tools) 
* MinGW-w64 (GCC for Windows)

Install MinGW, the most firendly way was to download **mingw-get-setup.exe** and isntall follow the instructions, then install the packages you need from **MinGW Installer**. Finally add the bin path of MinGW and to the system path.

open the MSYS terminal, locate to the openBLAS directory, make the openBLAS and install 

```
make
make PREFIX=/c/Program Files/openblas install
```





.libPaths("C:\\Users\\hchen\\Documents\\R\\win-library\\3.0")
library(Rcpp)
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("mschubert/bhtsneR")
